## 🧠 Background

I'm a React developer-in-progress based in **Berlin**, with **8 years of experience in IT** as a **Software Tester**. Now, I'm diving into code full-time — building, learning, breaking things, and fixing them again.

I'm currently leveling up my front-end skills and preparing for the **Fullstack** journey ahead 🚀
